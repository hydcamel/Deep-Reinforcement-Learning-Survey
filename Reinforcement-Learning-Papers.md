***Mistakes teach us to clarify what we really want and how we want to live.*** That's the spirit of reinforcement 
learning: learning from the mistakes. Let's be the explorer in reinforcement learning!	


## Reinforcement Learning

- :star::star: ***Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning***, [[Nature 2015]](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf)
  - Most optimization algorithms assume that the samples are independently and identically distributed,
      while for reinforcement learning, the data is a sequence of action, which breaks the assumption.
  - Strong correlation btn data => break the assumption of stochastic gradient-based algorithms(re-sampling)
  - Experience replay(off-policy)
  - Iterative update Q-value

- :star: ***High-Dimensional Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation*** [[ICLR 2016]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438)
	- John Schulman, Philipp Moritz, Sergey Levine, Michael Jordan, Pieter Abbeel
	- In extremely high dimensional task(like continuous control in 3D environment), stability is a key point.
	- Propose an effective variance reduction scheme for policy gradients, which called generalized advantage estimation (GAE)
	-  Motivation of GAE: Supposed we have fixed length of steps, from eq.15,  we know that the bias of each advantage function is **k-dependent**. So, as k increases, the biased term becomes more ignorable, while the variance increases and vice versa. (if you found this concept is abstract, think of MC is unbiased but with high variance, while TD is biased, but with los variance)
	-  ***λ*** is a new concept included in this paper. 
		-  If λ = 0 (like eq.17), then we have low variance, and is biased
		-  If λ = 1 (like eq.18), then we have high variance, and is unbased
- :star: ***Recurrent Models of Visual Attention*** [[NIPS 2014]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6247) 
  - Volodymyr Mnih, Nicolas Heess, Alex Graves, Koray Kavukcuoglu
  - Motivation: computationally expensive when dealing with large image. Many attention methods computation cost is propotional to the image size.
  - Use the action control to attend part of image (define a Gaussian, and use treat the location(mean of Gaussian) as action)
  - Can be viewed as POMDP (partially observation markov decision process)
  - The location network is a 2D-Gaussian distribution
  - Action is stochastically drawn from the distribution of location network
  - Reward can be task-dependent (this paper is used in classification)
  - Use the policy gradient to optimize

  - David Silver, Aja Huang 
  - First stage: supervised learning policy network, including rollout policy and SL policy network(learn the knowledge from human experts)
    -  Rollout policy is used for predicting **fast** but relatively inaccurate decision
    -  SL policy network is used for initialization of RL policy network(improved by policy gradient) 
  - To prevent overfit, auto-generate the sample from self-play(half) and train with the KGS dataset(half)
  - Use Monte Carlo tree search with policy network and value network. To understand the MCTS more, plz refer to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#Principle_of_operation)
    - Selection: select the most promising action depends on Q+u(P) --> depth L
    - Expansion: after L steps, create a new child
    - Evaluation: evaluated by the mixture of value network and simulated rollout
    - Backup: Calculate and store the Q(s,a), N(s,a), which is used in Selection

	- Max Jaderberg, Volodymyr Mnih, Wojciech Marian Czarnecki, Tom Schaul, Joel Z Leibo, David Silver, Koray Kavukcuoglu
	- Introduce an agent that also maximises many other **pseudo-reward** functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning
	- The advantage of auxiliary tasks: in many environment the extrinsic reward is very sparse, which make the feature extractor hard to learn at the beginning. Giving some pseudo reward makes the learner know how to interpret the image at the initial stage.
	- They proposes two main auxiliary task: Pixel changes, Network features.
		- Pixel changes: maximally changing the pixels in each cell of an n*n non-overlapping grid placed over the input image :point_right: make the learner knows to move faster or avoid stopping (I guess)
		- Network features: maximally activating each of the units in a specific hidden layer :point_right: to fully use the hidden units
	- Section 4.1 "Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning" discuss why not use the pixel reconstruction loss

- ***Imitation Learning with Recurrent Neural Networks***[[arXiv 2016]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05241)
	- Khanh Nguyen
	- Aims to unify two sequence prediction network: learning to search(L2S) and recurrent neural network
	- supervised recurrent neural entwork makes an independent prediction at each time step, which suffers seriously from **compounding errors** since the input observations correlate and thus violate the identically independent distributed assumption required by any supervised approach. 
	-  L2S algorithms reduce a sequential prediction problem to learning a policy to traverse in a search space with minimum cost. It garantees that compounding errors grow linearly with trajectory lengths.
	-  Map the RNN components to L2S (take sequence2sequence for example): 
		-  hidden representation :point_right: St
		-  decoded word :point_right: At 
		-  encoded word :point_right: Xt (new information for the environment)
		-  The non-linear gates in RNN are served to be the trainsition function
- ***Language Understanding for Text-based Games Using Deep Reinforcement Learning*** [[NMNLP 2015]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08941)
	- Karthik Narasimhan, Tejas Kulkarni, Regina Barzilay
	- Use natural language as state representation, and fixed action space (not output natural language in free-form :point_right: major restriction)
		- :star: challenging part: the environment is not directly observable
		- The task includes text interpretation and learning strategy build on the text interpretation 
	- 	Use LSTM to interpret the state(in natural langiage form), and use DQN to select to corresponding action
	-  Basically follow the [deepmind paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html). With experience replay and mini-batch update
	-  Using tSNE for the represnetation analysis is really cool (fig. 5)
- ***Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms*** [[ICML 2014]](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/silver14.pdf)
  - D. Silver, G. Lever, N. Heess, T. Degris, D. Wierstra, M. Riedmiller
  - The deterministic policy gradient is just a special case for stochastic policy gradient
  - **Problem of stochastic policy gradient**: as the policy become more and more deterministic, the variance of the policy gradient become larger an larger. Finally, become two delta function :point_right: end up computing the gradient of Q 
  - The stochatic policy gradient ends up calculating the gradient of Q(s,a), a is the mean mean of the policy(assume that the policy is a normal distribution)
  - Intuition: update policy in the direction that ***most improve Q***
  - The trade-off of determinisitic policy: exploration :point_right: off-policy deterministic actor-critic (exploration in Q-learning)
  - In continuous action spaces, greedy policy improvement becomes problematic, requiring a global maximisation at
      every step. Instead, a simple and computationally attractive alternative is to move the policy in the direction 
      of the gradient of Q, rather than globally maximising Q
  - David Silver's talk about [deterministic policy gradient](http://techtalks.tv/talks/deterministic-policy-gradient-algorithms/61098/) in ICML :point_right: very clear!
- ***Prioritized Experience Replay*** [[ICML 2016]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)
  -  Tom Schaul, John Quan, Ioannis Antonoglou, David Silver
  -  Use prioritized sampling rather than uniformly sampling
  -  Use transition’s TD error δ, which indicates how **"surprising" or "unexpected" the transition is**
  -  Alleviate the loss of diversity with stochastic prioritization, and introduce bias
  -  Stochastic Prioritization: mixture of pure greedy prioritization and uniform random sampling
- ***Deep Successor Reinforcement Learning*** [[arXiv 2016]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02396)
  - Tejas D. Kulkarni, Ardavan Saeedi, Simanta Gautam, Samuel J. Gershman
  - Successor Representation(SR): decomposed the value into successor map and reward predictor (the definition of the components in successor representation should be referred to section 3.2)
  - Advantage1: increase the sensitivityof the environment changes, since it records the immediate reward in each 
    state. In DQN, we only record(or predict) the accumulated reward, so the sudden change of reward will be diluted.
    However, the SR mehtod records the reward in each state: R(s), which enable it to be more sensitive to the change
    of environment.
  - Advantage2: able to extract the bottleneck states(subgoals). Since we predict the successor map (the predicted
      visit count), the state with higher visit count is likely to be bottleneck 
  - Section 3.3 is a little tricky. The m_sa represents the **feature of the future occupancy**, so m_sa×W becomes 
      the future accumulated reward (Q-value). The ∅(s)×W is the **immediate reward**. Therefore, 
      m_sa = φ(s) + γE[m_st+1a'] :point_right: eq.6

  - **Deep** version of DPG(deterministic policy gradient)
  - When going deep, some issues will happens. It's unstable to use the non-linear function to approxiamate 
  - The different components of the observation may have different physical units and the ranges may vary 
      across environments. => solve by batch normalization

## Inverse Reinforcement Learning
- ***Algorithms for Inverse Reinforcement Learning*** [[ICML 2000]](http://www.andrewng.org/portfolio/algorithms-for-inverse-reinforcement-learning/)
	- Andrew Y. Ng, Stuart Russell
	- In examing animal and human behavior we must consider the reward function as an unknown to be ascertained through empirical investigation.
	- Recover the expert's reward function and this to generate desired behavior
	- Use the eq.4 (see the derivation in the paper, which is quite clear)
	- Avoid reward function ambiguity by adding margin λ|R|
	- Use feature representation for the reward function
		- Since the reward function is assumed to be the linear combination of features, this implies that **if two policy with similar accumulated feature expectation, the accumulated reward is similar**
	- Experiment part shows IRL is soluble at least in **moderate** discrete, continuous space
	- Reference: [Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa12/slides/inverseRL.pdf), by Pieter Abbeel.
- ***Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning*** [[AAAI 2008]](https://www.cs.uic.edu/pub/Ziebart/Publications/maxentirl-bziebart.pdf)
	- Brian D. Ziebart, Andrew Maas, J. Andrew Bagnell, and Anind K. Dey
	- Close to the real case :point_right: the suboptimal case, optimal case can't cover all the state space, and alleviate the reward function ambiguity
	- basic concept: plans with equivalent rewards have equal probabilities, and plans with higher rewards are exponentially more preferred.
- ***Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning*** [[ICML 2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015430)
	- Pieter Abbeel, Andrew Y. Ng
	- The first time when apprenticeship is proposed
	- Most of these methods try to directly mimic the demonstrator by applying a **supervised learning** algorithm to learn a direct mapping from the states to the actions. :point_right: only suitable for the case that the taskis to mimic the expert’s trajectory
	- Reward function, rather than the policy or the value function, is the most succinct, robust, and transferable definition of the task,
	- Basic concept: use the inverse reinforcement learning to recover the reward function from the expert and use the that reward function to find the optimal policy.
	- Actually, Apprenticeship Learning doesn't need to find the correct reward function. Instead, it use the predicted reward function to find the policy that is similar to expert.
	- From the experiments, the apprenticeship learning need less sample trajectory than action mimic.
